> *"The chains that bound me have become the weapons of my vengeance..."*

A 2D action-packed dungeon crawler game built in Unity where players take on the role of a betrayed knight seeking freedom, revenge, and the truth behind their imprisonment.

## 🧱 Game Overview

**Knight Fukusho** follows the dark journey of a once-noble knight who was betrayed by those he trusted and imprisoned in the depths of a forgotten dungeon. As torches flicker against damp stone walls and the distant screams of other prisoners fade into silence, our hero's resolve only strengthens.

Driven by burning hatred and an unwavering desire for freedom, he finally breaks his chains after years of confinement. Now, with nothing but his skill and fury, he battles the twisted creatures and corrupted guards that haunt the labyrinthine halls of his living nightmare.

With each enemy slain and each new area discovered, fragments of the truth begin to surface. Who orchestrated this betrayal? What dark purpose does this dungeon truly serve? And is what waits beyond these walls truly freedom—or something far more sinister?
