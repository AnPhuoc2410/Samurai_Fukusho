**Knight Fukusho** is an action-packed game that follows the journey of a knight who was betrayed and imprisoned in a dark dungeon. Driven by hatred and the longing for freedom, he breaks his chains, battles the monstrous creatures guarding his prison, and gradually uncovers the secrets of the one who locked him away. Players will experience thrilling adventures through eerie dungeons, face formidable beasts, and inch closer to escape—but is this truly just an ordinary prison break?
